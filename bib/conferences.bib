  abstract  = {The TOUCAN project proposed an ontology for telecommunication networks with hybrid technologies â€“ the TOUCAN Ontology (ToCo), available at http://purl.org/toco/, as well as a knowledge design pattern Device-Interface-Link (DIL) pattern. The core classes and relationships forming the ontology are discussed in detail. The ToCo ontology can describe the physical infrastructure, quality of channel, services and users in heterogeneous telecommunication networks which span multiple technology domains. The DIL pattern is observed and summarised when modelling networks with various technology domains. Examples and use cases of ToCo are presented for demonstration.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present SARA, a Semantic Access point Resource Allocation service for heterogenous wireless networks with various wireless access technologies existing together. By automatically reasoning on the knowledge base of the full system provided by a knowledge based autonomic network management system - SEANET, SARA selects the access point providing the best quality of service among the different access technologies. Based on an ontology assisted knowledge based system SEANET, SARA can also adapt the access point selection strategy according to customer defined rules automatically. Results of our evaluation based on emulated networks with hybrid access technologies and various scales show that SARA is able to improve the channel condition, in terms of throughput, evidently. Comparisons with current AP selection algorithms demonstrate that SARA outperforms the existing AP selection algorithms. The overhead in terms of time expense is reasonable and is shown to be faster than traditional access point selection approaches.},

  abstract  = {Modern Software Defined Networking (SDN) control stacks consist of multiple abstraction and virtualization layers to enable flexibility in the development of new control features. Rich data modeling frameworks are essential when sharing information across control layers. Unfortunately, existing Network Operating System (NOS) data modeling capabilities are limited to simple type-checking and code templating. We present an exploration of a more extreme point on SDN data modeling: ReasoNet. Developers can use semantic web technologies to enrich their data models with reasoning rules and integrity/consistency constraints, and automate state inference across layers. We demonstrate the ability of ReasoNet to automate state verification and cross-layer debugging, through the implementation of two popular control applications, a learning switch and a Quality of Service (QoS) policy engine.},
