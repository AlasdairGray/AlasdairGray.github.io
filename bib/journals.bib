  abstract = {Information management during the construction phase of a built asset involves multiple stakeholders using multiple software applications to generate and store data. This is problematic as data come in different forms and are labour intensive to piece together. Existing solutions to this problem are predominantly in proprietary applications, which are sometimes cost prohibitive for small engineering firms, or conceptual studies with use cases that cannot be easily adapted. In view of these limitations, this research presents an ontology-based data integration framework that makes use of open-source tools that support Semantic Web technologies. The proposed framework enables rapid answering of queries over construction data integrated from heterogeneous sources, data quality checks and reuse of project software resources. The attributes and functionalities of the proposed solution align with the requirements common to small firms with limited information technology skill and budget. Consequently, this solution can be of great benefit for their data projects.},

  abstract  = {The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GtoPdb, www.guidetopharmacology.org) and its precursor IUPHAR-DB, have captured expert-curated interactions between targets and ligands from selected papers in pharmacology and drug discovery since 2003. This resource continues to be developed in conjunction with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the British Pharmacological Society (BPS). As previously described, our unique model of content selection and quality control is based on 96 target-class subcommittees comprising 512 scientists collaborating with in-house curators. This update describes content expansion, new features and interoperability improvements introduced in the 10 releases since August 2015. Our relationship matrix now describes ∼9000 ligands, ∼15 000 binding constants, ∼6000 papers and ∼1700 human proteins. As an important addition, we also introduce our newly funded project for the Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (GtoImmuPdb, www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org). This has been ‘forked’ from the well-established GtoPdb data model and expanded into new types of data related to the immune system and inflammatory processes. This includes new ligands, targets, pathways, cell types and diseases for which we are recruiting new IUPHAR expert committees. Designed as an immunopharmacological gateway, it also has an emphasis on potential therapeutic interventions.},
